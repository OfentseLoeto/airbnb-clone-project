# airbnb-clone-project
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.


The Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Team Roles

Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

Database Designs

Entities:
Users
- Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (host/guest)
- Relations: A user can host multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

Properties
- Fields: `id`, `user_id` (host), `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`
- Relations: A property belongs to one host (user) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

Bookings
- Fields: `id`, `user_id` (guest), `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- Relations: A booking belongs to one user (guest) and one property.

Reviews
- Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- Relations: A review is written by a user for a specific property.

Payments
- Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`
- Relations: A payment is linked to one booking.

Relationship Overview:

- A User can host multiple Properties.  
- A User (as guest) can create multiple Bookings.  
- A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.  
- A Booking has one Payment.

Feature Breakdown

1. API Documentation
The project uses the OpenAPI standard for clear and consistent API documentation, ensuring easy integration for developers. Both Django, REST Framework and GraphQL are supported, offering flexibility for CRUD operations and custom queries.

2. User Authentication
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles through dedicated endpoints. This ensures secure access and allows the system to distinguish between hosts and guests.

3. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature enables users to showcase properties with essential details like location, price, and availability.

4. Booking System
Guests can make, update, and manage bookings for available properties. It includes check-in and check-out details, ensuring smooth reservation handling.

5. Payment Processing
Payments are linked directly to bookings, allowing secure and traceable transactions. This ensures both guests and hosts have a reliable way to handle financial exchanges.

6. Review System
Users can post and manage reviews for properties they have stayed at. This fosters trust in the platform by providing feedback for both hosts and future guests.

7. Database Optimizations
Indexes and caching strategies are implemented to improve query performance and reduce database load. This ensures the application remains scalable and efficient as data grows.

API Security

Securing the backend APIs is a critical part of the project to protect user data, ensure trust, and maintain system reliability. 

The following measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication
Only verified users can access protected endpoints using secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth2).  
Why: Prevents unauthorized access and ensures only valid users interact with the system.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control will restrict what actions users can perform (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only guests can book).  
Why: Protects resources by ensuring users only perform actions aligned with their roles.

3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame.  
Why: Prevents abuse such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

4. Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.  
Why: Protects confidential information from being exposed to attackers.

5. Input Validation
All input will be validated and sanitized before being processed by the backend.  
Why: Prevents common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

6. Secure Payments
Payment processing will follow PCI-DSS compliance and rely on trusted third-party providers.  
Why: Ensures financial transactions remain safe and reduces the risk of fraud.
